## Cloud Firestore program using Flutter

This program demonstrate how to create a cloud firestore database and access the content of the database from witihin Android app using Flutter. The program has been tested to work with these configurations: Android Studio ver Arctic Fox/2020.3.1, Flutter SDK ver 2.8.0, Windows 10 64-bit, and Cloud Firestore ver 3.1.5. The program also has been tested to run on Android emulator, but can also run on iOS and web browser (Chrome or Edge) with certain configuration.
